This is the first project in Odin's project

The goal is to make a basic recipe website using only HTML,
and learn how to use GitHub and set repositories correctly

I do not own any of the recipes or the images used in this project.

All the recipes can be found originaly in the site below
https://www.allrecipes.com/

All used images are only for study purpouse
